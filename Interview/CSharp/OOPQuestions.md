# what is OOPs ?
OOPs is a technique (not a technology) that we can think of in terms of real-world objects while developing applications.
# What are principles of OOPs ?
OOPs principles are classified into four types. 
1. [Encapsulation ](#what-is-encapsulation-with-example) <!-- omit in toc -->
2. [Abstraction ](#what-is-abstraction-with-example)
3. [Inheritance ](#what-is-inheritance-with-example)
4. [Polymorphism ](#what-is-polymorphism-with-example)

# What is Encapsulation with example?
* Encapsulation is a process hiding internal details of an object, and exposing only the necessary information to outside world. 
* This is achieved through the use of [access modifiers](#what-are-access-modifiers-or-specifiers-available-in-c) such as private and public.
# What are access modifiers or specifiers available in C# ?
* Access modifiers or specifiers are the keywords that are used to specify the accessibility or scope of variables , functions and class in the C# application.
* C# provides five types of access specifiers.
  
  1. [Private](#private)
  2. [Public](#public)
  3. [Protected](#protected)
  4. [Internal](#internal)
  5. [Protected Internal ](#protected-internal)
# Private
If members (variables or methods ) are marked as **private**, they can be accessed only within the same class.
# Public
* If members (variables or methods) are declared as **public**, those members can be accessed from anywhere.
# Protected 
* if members declared as **protected** can be accessed in same class and by derived classes in same / other assemblies. 
# Internal 
* If members declared as **internal** can be accessed only within the same assembly.
*  This is the default access specifier if not specified when declaring any member (variable / method) or class.
# Protected Internal 
* If members declared as **protected internal** can be accessed within the same assembly or by derived classes in other  assemblies.
* It is combines the protection of the protected access specifier and the visibility of the internal access specifier.
